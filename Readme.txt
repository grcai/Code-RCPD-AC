RCPD_AC
==========

Introduction
------------

Our algorithm is implemented by MATLAB;
RCPD_AC.m is the source program of our clustering algorithm, which employs our new similarity (RCPD) to agglomerative clustering; 
RCPD.m is a subprogram to compute our new similarity in RCPD-AC.m;
The test code is test.m;
You can use any test dataset with its suggested parameters to test our method.
